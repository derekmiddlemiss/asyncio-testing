# AsyncioTesting Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of actionable improvement tasks for the AsyncioTesting project. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Architecture and Project Structure

1. [ ] Create a proper README.md file with project description, installation instructions, and usage examples
2. [ ] Add a LICENSE file to specify the project's licensing terms
3. [ ] Implement a more organized package structure with clear separation of concerns
4. [ ] Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file with guidelines for contributors
5. [ ] Add a CHANGELOG.md file to track version changes
6. [ ] Set up continuous integration (CI) with GitHub Actions or similar tool
7. [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for code quality checks

## Code Quality and Documentation

8. [ ] Improve docstrings with more detailed explanations and examples
9. [ ] Add type hints to all functions and methods (already started but could be more comprehensive)
10. [ ] Generate API documentation using a tool like Sphinx
11. [ ] Add inline comments for complex code sections
12. [ ] Create a style guide for consistent code formatting
13. [ ] Implement logging throughout the codebase with appropriate log levels

## Error Handling and Robustness

14. [ ] Enhance error handling in `run_in_subprocess.py` to handle more edge cases
15. [ ] Add timeout parameter to `run_in_subprocess` function with a default value
16. [ ] Implement retry mechanism for transient failures
17. [ ] Add proper exception hierarchy for different types of subprocess errors
18. [ ] Improve cancellation handling to ensure no orphaned processes

## Testing

19. [ ] Increase test coverage to at least 90%
20. [ ] Add integration tests for real-world scenarios
21. [ ] Implement property-based testing for edge cases
22. [ ] Add stress tests for handling multiple concurrent subprocesses
23. [ ] Create test fixtures for common test scenarios
24. [ ] Add tests for different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)
25. [ ] Implement performance benchmarks

## Features and Enhancements

26. [ ] Add support for environment variable configuration in subprocesses
27. [ ] Implement streaming output from subprocesses instead of waiting for completion
28. [ ] Add progress reporting for long-running subprocesses
29. [ ] Create utility functions for common shell command patterns
30. [ ] Add support for input redirection to subprocesses
31. [ ] Implement resource limiting for subprocesses (CPU, memory)
32. [ ] Add support for running commands in Docker containers

## Dependencies and Packaging

33. [ ] Complete the project description in pyproject.toml
34. [ ] Add project URLs (homepage, repository, documentation) to pyproject.toml
35. [ ] Specify minimum versions for all development dependencies
36. [ ] Add runtime dependencies if needed
37. [ ] Configure packaging for PyPI distribution
38. [ ] Create a Docker image for the project
39. [ ] Add support for different Python versions (3.8+)

## Performance Optimization

40. [ ] Profile the code to identify performance bottlenecks
41. [ ] Optimize subprocess creation and management
42. [ ] Implement caching for repeated commands
43. [ ] Add support for parallel execution of multiple commands
44. [ ] Optimize memory usage for large output handling

## Security

45. [ ] Add security checks for shell injection vulnerabilities
46. [ ] Implement proper handling of sensitive information in commands
47. [ ] Add option for running commands in restricted environments
48. [ ] Create security guidelines for using the library safely
